# Mute Sound after X seconds

Mostly stolen but slightly modified version of Minigamer42's script that you can find here:
https://github.com/Minigamer42/scripts/blob/7825d5c2440a81a6f17d52d9493d44a88eb8bed6/src/mute%20amq%20sound%20for%20x%20seconds.user.js#L32

The script is ment to make games more difficult. For example: If you're playing with a friend that's a bit newer at the game and you want to give yourself a handicap. 

## Example use: `/ms 10`
- Mutes sound after 10 seconds

## Example use: `/ms -1`
- Disables the muting of sound
